      <description>TEPREL-1B is a liquid bi-propellant rocket engine developed by PLD Space, a Spanish company working towards a slot in the micro satellite launchers. This engine will be used in MIURA-1 a suborbital vehicle that will be able to carry a 100kg payload to 153km and also serve as a testbed for several technologies. The available specs of the engine are as follows:
 Propellants: Liquid oxigen (LOX) &amp;amp; Rocket grade kerosne (RP1) Engine cycle: Pressure-fed (helium as pressurant) Thrust (sea level): 30kN Burn time: 122 seconds  On top of this, we also know that the vehicle carries 1000l of LOX and 600l of RP1 [1][2]</description>

      <description>As a rocketry enthusiast, I find it fascinating how rocket engine nozzles work. A while back, I got my hands on a copy of Rocket Propulsion Elements, an in-depth technical book that goes over the ins and outs of rocket propulsion! Chapter 3 focuses on how a nozzle converts the high-pressure low-velocity combustion gases, into a low-pressure fast stream of gas. The fast stream of gases leaving the nozzle is what generates thrust, according to Newton&#39;s third law: for every acting force, there is an opposite force of equal magnitude acting in the opposite direction.</description>

      <title>Haack Series nose cone generator and exporter</title>

      <description>After the initial research generating the 2D Haack nose cone, I finished the full 3D generator. This tool allows you to tweak and export the nose cone as an OBJ. The generator is unitless! So just be consistent with your CAD program units.
Settings     Haack Param    0.33     Nose Length       Nose Radius       Number of Segments(vertical divisions)    256     Radii(horizontal divisions)    64     Generate shoulder       Shoulder Length        Shoulder Radius                 var container = document.</description>

      <title>Ray-Cylinder intersection</title>

      <description>For a given cylinder with radius $R$ and height $H$, a ray with origin $P$ and direction $RD$, find the first intersection point $P&#39;$ between the ray and the cylinder.First, I will simplify the problem by flatening the ray (so effectively this becomes a 2D problem). You can understand this as trying to figure out the intersection point between the ray and a slice of the cylinder.$C$ is the slice center: $(Cylinder_x, P_y, Cylinder_z)$</description>

      <description>As a rocket designer, there are many nose cone types to choose from. For low to mid power rocketry, the choice can be based more on looks than anything else. Rockets reaching transonic and supersonic speeds should definetly make a fact based decission. For my next build I want to use a Haack nose cone, because I will be 3D printing it, I need a way of generating a 3D mesh.</description>

      <description>Every time I&#39;m starting a new rocket design, I find myself opening google and looking for the exact dimensions of each estes body tube and the motors. I decided to put together that information in tables for easy access. I gathered all the values from the Estes webpage.Body Tubes    Name ID OD Wall Length     BT-5 13.2mm 13.8mm 0.3mm 457mm   BT-20 18mm 18.</description>

      <description>Welcome! I decided that it was finally time to unify my blog and portfolio in one place. Before, I had Blogger running my blog. On the other hand, I created a simple github page to host my portfolio. Not good. And then HUGO appeared. I noticed this while reading someone else&#39;s blog and oh boi. Here we are! I have to say that HUGO is quite nice and easy to use.</description>
