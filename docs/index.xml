      <description>Every time I&#39;m starting a new rocket design, I find myself opening google and looking for the exact dimensions of each estes body tube. I decided to put together the values in a table for easy access. I took this values from the Estes webpage:    Name ID OD Wall Length     BT-5 13.2mm 13.8mm 0.3mm 457mm   BT-20 18mm 18.7mm 0.35mm 457mm   BT-50 24.</description>

      <description>Welcome! I decided that it was finally time to unify my blog and portfolio in one place. Before, I had Blogger running my blog. On the other hand, I created a simple github page to host my portfolio. Not good. And then HUGO appeared. I noticed this while reading someone else&#39;s blog and oh boi. Here we are! I have to say that HUGO is quite nice and easy to use.</description>

      <description>2019 Software rasterizer Rasterization is something that as graphics programmer I deal with daily. However, the implementation details are not so obvious and there are plenty optimization techniques. My version of a rasterizer implements: perspective correct interpolation, rendering meshes, programable shaders, multi threaded binning and depth buffer. Source code
2018 Volumetric clouds rendering Rendering clouds has always been hard due to the nature of algorithms used to render it: some type of ray-casting.</description>
