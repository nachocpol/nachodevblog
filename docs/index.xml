      <description>Hi! My name is Ignacio Cortizo Pol (or Nacho, just Nacho). I was born in Vigo a lovely place in the North West of Spain. During the day, I work as graphics programmer at TT Games. My hobbies include rocketry, electronics, sailing, cooking and trekking.
If I had to list my top movies that would be: Gladiator, Interstellar, 2001: space odyssey, Moana, White Squall, Master and Commander, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol1, Lord of the Rings -ALL- and Start Wars(1-3 sorry old people).</description>

      <description>Welcome! I decided that it was finally time to unify my blog and portfolio in one place. Before, I had Blogger running my blog. On the other hand, I created a simple github page to host my portfolio. Not good. And then HUGO appeared. I noticed this while reading someone else&amp;rsquo;s blog and oh boi. Here we are!
I have to say that HUGO is quite nice and easy to use.</description>

      <description>2019 Software rasterizer Rasterization is something that as graphics programmer I deal with daily. However, the implementation details are not so obvious and there are plenty optimization techniques. My version of a rasterizer implements: perspective correct interpolation, rendering meshes, programable shaders, multi threaded binning and depth buffer. Source code..
2018 Volumetric clouds rendering Rendering clouds has always been hard due to the nature of algorithms used to render it: some type of ray-casting.</description>
