Until this point, I have been launching model rockets using BP Estes motor packs. For those who don't know, in rocketry there are two principal types of motors:
{{%format/text-align-justify%}}

* **Black Powder(BP):** most common motors for low-mid rocketry. Propellant is black powder pellets, specific impulse of 80s. Single use.
* **Ammonium perchlorate(AP):** used in high power rocketry, can be either single use or reloadable. Specific impulse above 180s. 

> Specific impulse is a value that tells us how efficient a fuel is. It can be expressed as a unit of time, or a unit of velocity. For this case, we stick with time: Specific Impulse in seconds defines how many seconds can the propellant accelerate its initial mass at 1G.

I have plans of getting certified (more about that in another post), but it will involve designing a bigger rocket that will use an AP motor. As I have no experience using this motors, I decided to make a smaller rocket first (that will also run on AP). This rocket will serve as a test for new building techniques and I would love to add some electronics to start getting a hand of that as well. The main requirements for this rocket are:

* Should use a reloadable AP motor.
* Try new building techniques: ply wood fins with slots, use epoxy, ovearll stronger!
