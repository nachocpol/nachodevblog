# Welcome!

I decided that it was finally time to unify my blog and portfolio in one place. Before, I had Blogger running my blog. On the other hand, I created a simple github page to host my portfolio. Not good. And then HUGO appeared. I noticed this while reading someone else's blog and oh boi. Here we are! 

I have to say that HUGO is quite nice and easy to use. One thing to keep in mind, is that URL's are a bit annoying. I had to bang my head against the keyboard a couple times before figuring out what the heck was going on. Because I'm using a relative path for the **baseURL=https://piluve.github.io/nachodevblog/** , HUGO decided that /nachodevblog/ wasn't cool enough and removed it from every link and path reference! Doh. To be fair, I'm probably just using it wrong LOL. Anyways, the fix for this was to remove the '/' from all my relative links:

	/posts/ => posts/

And thats it! Web done. See ya!

Anyways, hoppefully I will get things sorted and start posting cool(not that cool) stuff.
Thanks!
Nacho.
