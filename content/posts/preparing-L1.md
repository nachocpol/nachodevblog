# L1 Certification

This is the first certification level required for using motors above H up to I (btw 160N/s and 640N/s). To succed you need:

* Stable flight
* Events should happen as described previous to fligh
* No parts can fly off the rocket!
* Rocket must survive the landing, minor scratches are permited. Exceptions due to landing on hard surfaces.

Also, I must pass with at least 90% a multi-choice exam.

## Choice of motor
H163 29mm Cesaroni 3-Grain (White Thunder),up to 14sec delay, 1.0s. burn time, 159N/s avg thrust, 216.9 max thrust, 187mm length

Before the certification flight I want to test the rocket with a smaller motor to make sure everything works as expected. A good candidate would be:

F31 29mm Cesaroni 1-Grain, up to 12sec delay, 1.8s. burn time, 55N/s avg thrust, 65.9 max thrust, 98mm length

I have never use AP motors, so testing with a smaller motor is a requirement.


Consideration time! 
This configuration with a 57mm airframe can go up to 900m... Also, the acceleration on the motor is crazy nuts.

Another option would be to use a 38mm motor instead!
