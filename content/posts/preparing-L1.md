# L1 Certification

This is the first certification level required for using motors above H up to I (btw 160N/s and 640N/s). To succed you need:

* Stable flight
* Events should happen as described previous to fligh
* No parts can fly off the rocket!
* Rocket must survive the landing, minor scratches are permited. Exceptions due to landing on hard surfaces.

Also, I must pass with at least 90% a multi-choice exam.

## Choice of motor

For this flight, I'll use a reloadable AP motor. To be more precise, a Cesaroni Pro29 3 grains. 

This is new for me, as I've only used single use BP motors.

Several components make up this configuration:

+ Motor case: http://www.pro38.com/pdfs/Pro29_dimensions.pdf
+ Motor tube: https://locprecision.com/product/motor-mount-tubing/
+ Motor retainer
+ Reload
+ Aft closure
