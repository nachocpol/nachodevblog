As a rocket designer, there are many nose cone types to choose from. For low to mid power rocketry, the choice can be based more on looks than anything else. Rockets reaching transonic and supersonic speeds should definetly make a fact based decission. For my next build I want to use a Haack nose cone, because I will be 3D printing it, I need a way of generating a 3D mesh. In this first post, I will explore how to generate a Haack profile.

### Haack Series

As oposed to other nose cones, Haack series do not represent a geometric figure, but they are created following a formula that tries to minimize drag.
