Hi! My name is Ignacio Cortizo Pol (or Nacho, just Nacho). I was born in Vigo a lovely place in the North West of Spain. During the day, I work as graphics programmer at TT Games. My hobbies include rocketry, electronics, sailing, cooking and trekking. 

If I had to list my top movies that would be: Gladiator, Interstellar, 2001: space odyssey, Moana, White Squall, Master and Commander, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol1, Lord of the Rings -ALL- and Start Wars(1-3 sorry old people). In terms of cartoons/anime: Steins;Gate, Avatar the last airbender, Shingeki no Kyojin and Sword Art Online S1.
