I studied Games Programming in Valencia, Spain and then came to the UK to finish my BSc. During the last year of my studies, I focused mainly in graphics. My first job was at Simul Software, from there, I moved to TT games, where I worked on the new Star Wars game. I'm currently working at Playground Games on Fable!
